tokudb_load
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBtokudb_load
dbfilename
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tokudb_load
program reads key/data pairs from standard input and writes them into a TokuDB
database.
The format of the key/data pairs is compatible with the 
.B tokudb_dump
program and the Berkeley DB load and dump
programs.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The TokuDB embedded database provides a subset of the functionality of
the Berkeley DB.  Programs that work with TokuDB probably work with
with most versions of Berkeley DB with only recompilation or
relinking.  The database files are incompatible, however, so to
convert from one library to the other you would need to dump the
database with one library's tool and load it with the other's.
