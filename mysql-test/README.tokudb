The mysql tests for TokuDB consist of tests that are common to all MySQL distributions
and tests that are specific to each MySQL distribtion. 

The common mysql tests are stored in the svn:tokudb/mysql/tests/mysql-test directory.

The distribution specifc tests are stored with each MySQL distribution.  For example,
tests specific to MySQL 5.1.61 can be found in the svn:tokudb/mysql.com/mysql-5.1.61/mysql-test
directory.

We assemble tests from these places in the following order.  First, the common mysql tests 
are checked out of the subversion repository.  Then, the distribution specific tests are 
overlayed onto the common tests.  This allows a distribution specific test to replace the
behaviour captured in a common test.  Please see the run.mysql.tests.bash script for
an example of how this works.
