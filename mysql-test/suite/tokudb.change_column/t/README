= Hot column change operations =
 * varchar(X) -> varchar(Y) for all 0 <= X <= Y < 64K
 * varchar(X) not null -> varchar(Y) not null for all 0 <= X <= Y < 64K
 * varbinary(X) -> varbinary(Y) for all 0 <= X <= Y < 64K
 * varbinary(X) not null -> varbinary(Y) not null for all 0 <= X <= Y < 64K
 * tinyint -> smallint -> mediumint -> int -> bigint
 * tinyint unsigned -> smallint unsigned-> mediumint unsigned -> int unsigned -> bigint unsigned 
 * tinyint not null -> smallint not null -> mediumint not null -> int not null -> bitint not null
 * tinyint unsigned not null -> smallint unsigned not null -> mediumint unsigned not null -> int unsigned not null -> bitint unsigned not null
 * char(X) -> char(Y) for all 0 <= X <= Y < 256
 * char(X) not null -> char(Y) not null for all 0 <= X <= Y < 256
 * binary(X) -> binary(Y) for all 0 <= X <= Y < 256
 * binary(X) not null -> binary(Y) not null for all 0 <= X <= Y < 256

= Changes to the row value = 
 * Variable length offsets expand from 1 to 2 bytes
 * Fixed field value is expanded
 * Sign bit for signed integers is expanded
 * Pad for fixed char fields is a space
 * Pad for fixed binary fields is a zero

= Restrictions =
 * Changed field is not part of any key
